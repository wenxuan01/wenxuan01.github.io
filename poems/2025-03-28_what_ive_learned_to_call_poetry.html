<p>  What I've learned to call poetry -
<br> just words scattered on paper, littered
<br> with line breaks. Capturing
<br> the flow of conversation, to be consumed
<br> by myself again.

<p>  It makes me feel important, this
<br> filling up of pages with pretty ink.
<br> Perhaps this will be my legacy -
<br> Pages from a deranged poet losing his mind.
